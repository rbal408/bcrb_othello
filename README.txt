*** More to come ***

To improve our AI this week, we focused on trying to adjust some of the calculations we used in the heuristic function, as well 
as our heuristic calc that we tried to use to get our minimax to work. Since our Heuristic only won 6/10 times,
and our minimax didn't really work that well, we decided to alter some of the numbers/techniques we 
used to achieve these calculations. After playing with the numbers for a little bit, we saw some improvement,
in the performances of our Heuristic and our minimax. We also spent some time attempting to implement
alpha-beta pruning, but couldn't get it to compile in time to submit the assignment.
