Rather than assigning certain functions and coding to each member, a lot of the actual coding that we did was together in a room, so it is hard to distinguish exactly which code came from which group member.


To improve our AI this week, we focused on trying to adjust some of the calculations we used in the heuristic function, as well 
as our heuristic calc that we tried to use to get our minimax to work. Since our Heuristic only won 6/10 times,
and our minimax didn't really work that well, we decided to alter some of the numbers/techniques we 
used to achieve these calculations. After playing with the numbers for a little bit, we saw no improvement,
in the performances of our Heuristic and our minimax, so we resorted to maintaining the same regular Heuristic function. We also spent some time attempting to implement
alpha-beta pruning, but couldn't get it to compile in time to submit the assignment.
In addition, we added a couple of comments to our code to make it more readable.
